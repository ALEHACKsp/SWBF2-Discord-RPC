# SWBF2-Discord-RPC

DLL for Star Wars Battlefront 2 that enables Discord's Rich Presence in the 
game.  Reads a bunch of pointers, extensively parses the data (for proper 
text, images, ect), then pipes that info over to discord to pick up.

Discord RPC lib is now staticly linked, so you can just inject without 
needing the other dll.
